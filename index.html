                <p> My name is John Filiaga. The Filiaga name comes from Samoa, although by looking at me,
                    Samoan may be the last nationality you would guess. That's on account of me being mixed
                    with Mexican, German, and English among various other ethnicites. I was born in Las Vegas,
                    Nevada, but have lived most of my life here in Utah with a couple short stints in California.
                    I graduated from Highland Highschool in Salt Lake City, and have spent some time attending
                    Weber State University in Ogden. When I'm not working anywhere from 8-12 hours shifts at a
                    Smith's
                    warehouse, I'm usually playing games (Heroes of the Storm/Civ), playing guitar (pretty
                    averagely),
                    or just hanging out with friends and family. I enjoy most generic activities like reading,
                    binge watching Netflix, sports (Jazz diehard), and all that other stuff. I'm an avid podcast
                    listener
                    which really comes
                    in handy when trying to learn new things (like coding!). There's not a whole lot of special
                    things
                    about me,
                    but I like to look at that as just me being well-rounded.
